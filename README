A raw Jupyter kernel and docker container for Walnut

There are plenty of ways to run me:

    $ docker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888 nopid/walnut

 2. as a local docker container built from this repo:
    $ docker build -t nopid/walnut .

 3. as a local docker container built with repo2docker:
    $ jupyter-repo2docker -p 8888:8888 http://github.com/nopid/jupywalnut jupyter-notebook

 4. completly remotely in your browser with mybinder:
